                        Natural Visions Landscaping was the first business I have owned and founded. Through this venture I
                        have gained knowledge and experience on all fronts of business operations such as marketing, branding, sales, accounting,
                        leadership, and money management. I received a $3,000 grant from the City of Vaughan as a sole proprietor for the purpose of
                        gaining startup capital.

                        VividShots Imaging was a business I founded as I was pushing myself to increase my knowledge and network. This company
                        specialized in real estate photography and was a way for me to not only increase my business experience but to also increase
                        my connections with other business owners and real estate agents in my area as I worked in commercial real estate photography.
                        Through this venture I refined my photography, photoshop, lightroom, and design skills as my creativity was put to the test in order
                        to capture high quality real estate images for clients.
